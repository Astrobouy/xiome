## how to work on xiome as a developer

&nbsp;üí° **prerequisites**
- install `git`, `nodejs`, `vscode`, and [connect github with ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
- if you're on windows, setup [wsl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)

&nbsp;üõ†Ô∏è **initial setup**
- fork the project on github, and clone your fork
- open a terminal in your cloned directory, and run these commands
  - `npm install` to install the project's dependencies
  - `npm run build` to build the project

&nbsp;‚öôÔ∏è **whenever you're developing**
- run these processes, each in their own terminal
  - `npm run watch` to continually rebuild source files on save
  - `npm start` to run a local http server at http://localhost:5000/
  - *note:* [tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) is a great way to split terminal windows
  - *note:* of course, when you're done, end each process by pressing `ctrl+c`
- open vscode by running `code .`
  - you should be able to see the xiome platform website at http://localhost:5000/x/
  - and the app development mocksite at http://localhost:5000/x/mocksite/
  - now you are ready to code
  - when you save a typescript or pug file, the watch routine will automatically rebuild it, so you can press refresh in the browser to see the changes
  - you can press vscode hotkey `ctrl+shift+b` to run the typescript build, which allows vscode to nicely highlight typescript errors for you to address

&nbsp;üß† **things to understand**
- mock mode
  - the watch routine builds xiome into a "mock" mode
  - in mock mode, you don't need to run the xiome server, or connect to any databases
  - all of xiome, including the backend business logic, is running in the browser (and is easily debuggable there)
